Let's look at some key things! We are going to focus on this big image we see first.

On every page we edit we will have the menu to the left. It will include some behind the scenes edits such as tags and the page author information.

>Remember a “block” is an area on the page with related information. A 
block can be one item or multiple depending on what you wish to accomplish



### *1.5*
Since this is a template they have given us some images but we don't want that! Let's start adding our own content! Click on the first image you see.

By clicking the image this allows you to edit this side show at the top of the page! Let's replace this first image with something of our own. When we do this we will add the image to our wordpress library 

Click Edit. This will allow you to add a new image to replace the one given from the template.

The next screen will showcase the images we previously used on the homepage. We can reuse these images or we can add new images for this page. With this tutorial we will add a new image. 

Click **Add new**


### *1.7*
This will open up file explorer on your computer (for Mac this will open Finder) from here you will have to find the image you want to add. Earlier we created a folder with all the information we wanted to use for our blog. Let's navigate to that folder

 menu to select Desktop, then the name of the folder created

You can choose one image or multiple, let's choose one for now. Click the image you want to add then click open
